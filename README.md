To install this customized theme you must create the directory `~/.atom/package`, if it doesn't exist.

Then you must download and copy this repository to `~/.atom/package`.
You might want to rename the repository directory and remove the `-master` part of the name, but that is completely optional. 

Restart atom and you're good to go :-)
